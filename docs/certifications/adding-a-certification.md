# Adding a certification — converting an exam dump into a cert-bundle JSON

You are converting a raw certification exam question dump (plain text, e.g. an
ExamTopics export) into the JSON format this app consumes. Read this whole
document before producing any output.

## Which document is which

You need **this one**. It is the complete authoring recipe: every field, the
stop-and-ask rule, the manifest entry, the theme rules, and a worked example
from a raw dump to finished JSON. Nothing here is optional reading.

Its companion, **`schema-reference.md`** (same directory), is the *normative*
schema — the field tables the validator implements, plus how a session's score
is computed and displayed. Read it when:

- you need the **exact** contract for a field this document summarizes, or
- you are changing **scoring or the score UI** rather than adding a cert.

Two things live only in `schema-reference.md` and are worth knowing even when
just authoring, because they change what you should write in `exam`:

1. **How `passingScore.scale` is used at runtime.** Setting `scale` makes the app
   display a *projected* scaled score (a linear projection, e.g. 75% → "750 /
   1000") with a mandatory disclaimer that it does not reproduce the real
   exam's scoring. Omit `scale` and the app treats `passingScore` as a plain
   percentage. So `scale` is not cosmetic: setting it wrongly makes the app
   display a number the real certification would never produce.
2. **User-progress structure** (`byExamCode`, replay modes, export format) —
   not authored by you, but useful context for what `exam.code` keys.

**Your draft is verified by a command, not by re-reading these docs.** When the
bundle and manifest are written, run:

```bash
npm run test:certs
```

It fails loudly on a malformed bundle, a missing or mismatched manifest entry, a
question count that disagrees with the file, and undeclared, unused, or missing
theme tags. Use it as the source of truth for "is this valid" rather than
trusting your own review — it is faster and stricter than re-reading a table.
`npm run test` is the full suite; run it before handing the work off.

## Rule #1 — stop and ask

This overrides every other instruction here.

- **Never guess.** If a **required** field (e.g. question text, options,
  answer letter, topic) or a piece of source data that must be preserved is
  ambiguous, missing, or contradictory in the source text, stop and ask the
  user for clarification instead of inventing a value. Explicitly optional
  fields — `url`, `explanation`, `promptImages`, and `themes` — may remain
  absent without blocking: if the source doesn't substantiate them, simply
  omit them (never fill them with guesses, `null`, `""`, or `[]`).
- **Never force-fit.** If a question doesn't fit this schema (see "Unsupported
  question types" below), say so and stop. Do not approximate it as a
  multiple-choice question.
- **Never silently drop data.** If you can't confidently place a piece of
  information (an image, a caveat in the discussion, an option you're unsure
  about), tell the user what you're unsure about and why, rather than omitting
  it without comment.

When in doubt, produce a shorter, correct, partial answer and ask, rather than
a complete but guessed one.

## Two deliverables, not one

Adding a certification takes **two** edits:

1. **The bundle** — `src/assets/<CODE> questions.json`, shaped like this:
2. **The manifest entry** — one object appended to `src/assets/cert-manifest.json`
   (see "Step 2" below).

Skipping the manifest entry yields a bundle that validates perfectly and then
**never appears in the app**. The manifest is the only thing that makes a cert
discoverable: `useQuizLoader.ts` iterates `cert-manifest.json`, and its
`import.meta.glob('/src/assets/*questions.json')` is used only to *load the
files the manifest already names* — it never discovers certs on its own. With
no entry, `ensureCertLoaded` finds no match and returns `false`, so the cert is
silently absent from the selector with no error logged anywhere. A green
validator run does not catch this.

## Output format

The bundle file:

```jsonc
{
  "version": 2,
  "exam": { /* ExamInfo, see below */ },
  "themes": { /* taxonomy registry, see below */ },
  "questions": [ /* Question[], see below */ ]
}
```

### `exam` (ExamInfo)

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | Full display name of the certification. |
| `code` | string | yes | Short unique code (e.g. `DVA-C02`, `SAA-C03`). Ask the user if unclear. |
| `totalQuestions` | number | yes | Question count on the **real** exam — not the size of the question bank you're converting. Ask the user; don't infer this from the dump's question count. The bank must hold **at least** this many answerable questions: exam mode always draws exactly this many, and `certManifest.test.ts` fails otherwise. |
| `timeLimitMinutes` | number | yes | Real exam duration in minutes. Ask the user if not stated anywhere in the source material. |
| `passingScore.passingScore` | number | yes | The passing score. A plain percentage (0-100) if the cert has no scaled score, or a scaled value (e.g. `720`) if it does. |
| `passingScore.scale` | number | no | Max of the scale (e.g. `1000`). Omit entirely for percentage-based certs. **Setting this changes the UI**: the app then shows a *projected* scaled score (a linear projection, e.g. 75% → "750 / 1000") with a disclaimer that it does not reproduce the real exam's scoring. Omitting it means `passingScore` is read as a plain percentage. Only set it when the certification genuinely uses a scaled score — never to "normalize" a number. |
| `weights` | `Record<string, number>` | no | Maps each topic name (must exactly match the `topic` values you assign to questions) to a percentage; values must sum to 100. Omit the whole field if the cert has no published domain weights — do not invent weights. |
| `instructions` | string | no | Free-text instructions shown to the user. |

### `themes` (taxonomy registry)

A dictionary of theme-group name → list of allowed values, e.g.:

```jsonc
"themes": {
  "services":      ["dynamodb", "lambda", "s3"],
  "concepts":      ["encryption", "caching"],
  "questionTypes": ["troubleshooting", "most-secure"]
}
```

- Keys are free-form, lowerCamelCase, and specific to the certification's
  domain (a networking cert might use `protocols`, `osiLayers`; a PMP cert
  might use `processGroups`, `knowledgeAreas`). Don't reuse AWS-specific
  groups for a non-AWS cert.
- Build this registry from the questions you actually tag — every value you
  put on a question should exist here. If you're not confident a tag is
  meaningful or consistent across questions, ask rather than inventing
  one-off tags.

#### Non-AWS example — the Claude certifications

The `services` / `concepts` / `questionTypes` trio above is AWS-specific and is
**not** the shape to copy for other domains. The four Claude bundles
(`CCA-F`, `CCAO-F`, `CCAR-P`, `CCDV-F`) use a different, deliberately
non-AWS taxonomy — the same free-form-key rule applied honestly:

```jsonc
"themes": {
  "tasks":         ["task-decomposition", "tool-interface-design", "workflow-enforcement"],
  "tools":         ["claude-code", "agent-sdk", "mcp", "tool-use"],
  "questionTypes": ["architecture-decision", "feature-selection", "most-cost-effective"]
}
```

Note what changed: `services` (AWS product names) became `tools` (Claude
product names), and `concepts` (generic architectural ideas) became `tasks`
(concrete agent capabilities). `questionTypes` survives because "pick the most
secure / most cost-effective option" is a property of the *question*, not of
the vendor — that group is reusable across domains, the other two are not.

A question from `CCA-F` shows the shape end to end:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "1",
  "question": "Production data shows that in 12% of cases, your agent skips `get_customer` entirely and calls `lookup_order` using only the customer's stated name...",
  "options": ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
  "answers": "A",
  "topic": "Agentic Architecture & Orchestration",
  "themes": {
    "tasks":         ["workflow-enforcement"],
    "tools":         ["tool-use"],
    "questionTypes": ["feature-selection"]
  }
}
```

The guiding test: if a tag would still make sense on a question from a
*different* vendor's exam in the same domain, it belongs in
`questionTypes`. If it names a product or a capability specific to this
ecosystem, it belongs in that cert's own groups.

### `questions[]` (Question)

```jsonc
{
  "id": "1",
  "question": "Full question text, unicode preserved.",
  "options": ["Option A text", "Option B text", "Option C text", "Option D text"],
  "answers": "C",
  "topic": "Security",
  "url": "https://... (optional, omit the field entirely if unavailable)",
  "explanation": "Why the correct answer is correct (optional). Don't make up things, fill only if an explanation is provided in the file provided",
  "promptImages": ["https://... (optional, only images belonging to the prompt itself)"],
  "themes": {
    "services": ["kms", "secrets-manager"],
    "concepts": ["encryption", "secrets-management"],
    "questionTypes": ["architecture-decision"]
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique within the file. Follow the bundle's own numbering: continue from the highest existing id rather than reusing the source dump's numbering (see the id rule below). |
| `question` | string | yes | Full prompt, unicode preserved. |
| `options` | string[] | yes | At least 2 entries, no `A. ` letter prefixes — the app renders letters itself. An image that belongs to a specific *option* (not the prompt) is embedded inline as markdown: `![alt](url)`. |
| `answers` | string \| string[] | yes | A single letter (`"C"`) for single-select, an array (`["B","D"]`) for multi-select. The cardinality must match the source question's type: single-select questions use a string — never a one-item array like `["C"]`; multi-select questions use an array with one entry per correct answer, matching the number of answers the source states. Arrays must be non-empty with no duplicate letters. Every letter must be within the `options` range. Take the accepted answer from the source; if the source shows disagreement (e.g. community votes conflicting with a stated "most accepted answer") and no answer is clearly authoritative, stop and ask. |
| `topic` | string | yes | The question's primary topic/domain. If `exam.weights` is present, this **must** be one of its keys — don't introduce a topic that isn't in the weights table without asking first. |
| `explanation` | string | no | Rationale for the correct answer, if the source material supports one. Don't fabricate an explanation the source doesn't substantiate. |
| `url` | string | no | Source/discussion link. Omit the field entirely if unavailable — never `null` or `""`. |
| `promptImages` | string[] | no | Images belonging to the **prompt** (diagrams, screenshots), not to an individual option. Omit entirely when empty. |
| `themes` | object | no | Nested object with `services` / `concepts` / `questionTypes` (or whatever groups this cert's `themes` registry defines) as string arrays. Omit a sub-array entirely when it doesn't apply to this question — never an empty array. |

## Unsupported question types — stop, don't force-fit

This schema only supports single-select and multi-select multiple choice.
If the source material contains any of the following, **do not** convert them
into a multiple-choice approximation — flag them to the user and skip them:

- Drag-and-drop / ordering questions
- Matching questions (pairing items from two columns)
- Simulation-style questions (interacting with a mocked console/UI)
- Any other format that isn't "pick one/several options from a fixed list"

QUESTION #1    Exam AWS Certified Developer - Associate DVA-C02 topic 1 question 1 discussion
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Question:
A company is implementing an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application needs to process incoming transactions. When the application detects a transaction that is not valid, the application must send a chat message to the company's support team. To send the message, the application needs to retrieve the access token to authenticate by using the chat API. A developer needs to implement a solution to store the access token. The access token must be encrypted at rest and in transit. The access token must also be accessible from other AWS accounts. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST management overhead?

Options:
  A. Use an AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store SecureString parameter that uses an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key to store the access token. Add a resource-based policy to the parameter to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Parameter Store. Retrieve the token from Parameter Store with the decrypt flag enabled. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.
  B. Encrypt the access token by using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Store the access token in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access DynamoDB and AWS KMS. Retrieve the token from DynamoDDecrypt the token by using AWS KMS on the EC2 instances. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.
  C. Use AWS Secrets Manager with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to store the access token. Add a resource-based policy to the secret to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Secrets Manager. Retrieve the token from Secrets Manager. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.
  D. Encrypt the access token by using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key. Store the access token in an Amazon S3 bucket. Add a bucket policy to the S3 bucket to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Amazon S3 and AWS KMS. Retrieve the token from the S3 bucket. Decrypt the token by using AWS KMS on the EC2 instances. Use the decrypted access token to send the massage to the chat.

Community Votes:
  A → 2 vote(s)
  C → 13 vote(s)

Most Accepted Answer:
  C. Use AWS Secrets Manager with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to store the access token. Add a resource-based policy to the secret to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Secrets Manager. Retrieve the token from Secrets Manager. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.

  "answers": "C",

Notes on how this was derived, since the reasoning isn't visible in the JSON
itself:

- `answers: "C"` comes from "Most Accepted Answer" — the community-vote count
  (`A → 2`, `C → 13`) corroborates it rather than contradicting it. If votes
  had favored a different answer than "Most Accepted Answer", that would be a
  case to stop and ask rather than pick one silently.
- `topic: "Security"` was assigned because the question is fundamentally about
  encrypting and cross-account-sharing a secret — it must be one of
  `exam.weights`' keys for this cert (see the DVA-C02 reference below).
- `themes.services` lists every AWS service the four options collectively
  reference (SSM, Secrets Manager, S3, KMS are the four storage options; IAM
  and EC2 are the compute/permissions context), not just the correct one —
  tag for what the question *involves*, not only the right answer.
- No `explanation` or `promptImages` were added: the source dump doesn't
  provide a substantiated rationale beyond the discussion thread's opinions,
  and there is no image in this question.

## DVA-C02 taxonomy reference

Use this reference when converting more DVA-C02 material, or as a model for
how granular a taxonomy should be for a similarly-scoped cert. Don't reuse it
for a different certification.

**Topics (4)**: `Development with AWS Services`, `Deployment`, `Security`, `Troubleshooting and Optimization`

**Services (33)**: `acm`, `amplify`, `api-gateway`, `cloudformation`, `cloudfront`, `cloudwatch`, `codebuild`, `codecommit`, `codedeploy`, `codepipeline`, `cognito`, `container`, `dynamodb`, `ec2`, `efs-ebs`, `elastic-beanstalk`, `elasticache`, `eventbridge`, `iam`, `kinesis`, `kms`, `lambda`, `rds-aurora`, `route53`, `s3`, `sam`, `secrets-manager`, `sns`, `sqs`, `ssm`, `step-functions`, `vpc`, `x-ray`

**Concepts (25)**: `api-design`, `authentication`, `authorization`, `caching`, `cicd-pipeline`, `cost-optimization`, `cross-account`, `data-modeling`, `deployment-strategies`, `disaster-recovery`, `encryption`, `event-driven`, `high-availability`, `iac`, `idempotency-retry`, `least-privilege`, `lifecycle-management`, `logging`, `microservices`, `observability`, `secrets-management`, `serverless`, `testing`, `throttling-concurrency`, `versioning-rollback`

**Question Types (8)**: `architecture-decision`, `configuration`, `how-to-deploy`, `most-cost-effective`, `most-performant`, `most-secure`, `multi-step-scenario`, `troubleshooting`

**Exam weights**: Development with AWS Services 32%, Deployment 24%, Security 26%, Troubleshooting and Optimization 18%

## Step 2 — register the cert in the manifest

Now add one object to the array in `src/assets/cert-manifest.json`. This step
is **not optional** and is easy to forget, because nothing warns you that you
skipped it.

```jsonc
[
  {
    "file": "CCA-F questions.json",      // exact file name, must match the bundle on disk
    "exam": {                            // must EQUAL the bundle's exam object, field for field
      "name": "Claude Certified Architect - Foundations",
      "code": "CCA-F",
      "totalQuestions": 60,
      "timeLimitMinutes": 120,
      "passingScore": { "passingScore": 720, "scale": 1000 },
      "weights": {
        "Agentic Architecture & Orchestration": 27
        // ...every topic you assigned, summing to 100
      }
    },
    "questionCount": 157                 // must equal questions.length exactly
  }
]
```

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `file` | The bundle's file name including the `.json` extension and the space: `"<CODE> questions.json"`. A mismatch throws at registry build time. |
| `exam` | Copy the bundle's `exam` object **verbatim**. `certManifest.test.ts` asserts `bundle.exam` deep-equals `entry.exam`, so a single drifting field — a changed `passingScore`, a dropped `instructions` — fails the test suite. |
| `questionCount` | `questions.length` in the bundle. Asserted with `toHaveLength`, so an off-by-one after deleting a question fails CI. It must also be at least `exam.totalQuestions` (answerable questions only). |

`src/assets/certManifest.test.ts` enforces all three, plus the reverse
direction: every `*questions.json` file on disk must have exactly one entry, and
every entry must pass `validateCertBundle`. Run `npm run test:certs` to confirm
both files agree — it is the fast gate to run after every bundle edit, and it
also enforces the theme rules below. Run the full `npm run test` before handing
the work off.

## Step 3 — compute the themes

Themes are the part of this schema most easily got wrong, and the most expensive
to get wrong quietly: an undeclared tag still passes schema validation, because
`validateCertBundle` treats an unknown theme value as a **warning**, not an
error. Nothing fails until a user picks a filter and gets no questions back.

So compute the registry **from the questions you already tagged**, never
beforehand. Then let `npm run test:certs` prove the two directions agree:

| Rule | Caught by | Typical cause |
|---|---|---|
| Every tag a question uses is declared in `themes` | `certThemes.test.ts` | tagging as you go and forgetting to register |
| Every declared value is used by some question | `certThemes.test.ts` | copying a sibling cert's registry wholesale |
| Every question carries at least one tag | `certThemes.test.ts` | skipping tagging on "obvious" questions |
| Sibling certs name their groups identically | `certThemes.test.ts` | renaming a group in one cert only |

The fourth rule matters most when adding a cert that has siblings (a second
`CCA-*` alongside `CCA-F`): reuse the **exact** group names already in use for
that family. A cert that invents its own group names yields a filter UI that
reads inconsistently across the selector, and no schema error will tell you.

Family membership is an explicit list, `CERT_FAMILY` in `src/assets/certThemes.test.ts`
(`aws`, `claude`). **Add your code to it when you add a cert** — the test fails on
an unmapped code, so you can't add a bundle silently. Membership is deliberately
*not* inferred from the data: `questionTypes` values such as `most-secure` are
reusable across vendors, so overlapping question types say nothing about whether
two certs should share a taxonomy.

After tagging, `npm run test:certs` must be green before you move on.

## Before you return the JSON — checklist

Bundle (`src/assets/<CODE> questions.json`):

- [ ] Top level has exactly `version` (`2`), `exam`, `themes`, `questions`.
- [ ] Every `options` array has at least 2 entries, none with an `A. `/`B. ` prefix.
- [ ] Every `answers` letter is within that question's `options` range.
- [ ] Every `topic` is present, and — if `exam.weights` exists — is one of its keys.
- [ ] No optional field is present as `null`, `""`, or `[]`; it's omitted entirely instead.
- [ ] Every value under a question's `themes` exists in the top-level `themes` registry.
- [ ] No drag-and-drop / matching / simulation question was force-fit — those were flagged and skipped instead.
- [ ] Anything you were unsure about was raised with the user, not guessed.

Manifest (`src/assets/cert-manifest.json`) — **the step that silently breaks
the cert if skipped**:

- [ ] An entry was added for this cert, with `file` matching the bundle's name exactly.
- [ ] `exam` is copied verbatim from the bundle (deep-equal, not a retyped approximation).
- [ ] `questionCount` equals `questions.length` in the bundle, and the bundle holds at least `exam.totalQuestions` answerable questions.
- [ ] `npm run test:certs` is green. It is the authority on validity: it fails on
      a malformed bundle, a missing/mismatched manifest entry, a `questionCount`
      that disagrees with the file, a bank smaller than the real exam, a tag a question uses but the registry does
      not declare, a declared value no question uses, an untagged question, and
      sibling certs whose theme groups are named differently.
